## 📝 Description

**SpaceDevs** is an application focused on astronomical exploration and scientific education. The project seeks to answer the intriguing question: *What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions?* Using the vast list of over 5500 exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the latest star catalogs, the application allows students to choose an exoplanet and view an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on computers and virtual reality displays.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The main language used in the application development.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **NASA API**: Used to fetch data on exoplanets and stars.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
